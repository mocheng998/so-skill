## Step 1: Choose an API

> Key decision factor: What data does the user already have (ASINs? keywords? categories?) and what result do they want?

### ① Historical Search Volume API
- Input: 1–5 keywords + date range (max 366 days)
- Output: Weekly aggregated search volume time series
- Use when: User wants to see how keyword search volume changes over time — seasonal curves, YoY growth, trend inflection points, ad timing windows, inventory planning
- Do NOT use when: User wants to expand/discover new keywords (→ ④), or see which keywords an ASIN ranks for (→ ②)

### ② Keywords by ASIN API
- Input: 1–10 ASINs
- Output: Keywords each ASIN ranks for (with rank position, search volume, PPC bid)
- Use when: User already has specific ASINs and wants to know "what keywords does this product rank on" — reverse keyword research, competitive keyword gaps, Listing SEO, share of search tracking
- Do NOT use when: User has no ASINs, only keywords to expand (→ ④), or wants historical search volume trends (→ ①)
- Key difference from ④: ② = "from ASIN → find keywords", ④ = "from keyword → find more keywords"

### ③ Sales Estimates API
- Input: 1–10 ASINs + date range (max 365 days)
- Output: Daily granularity sales, price, and revenue estimates
- Use when: User wants to quantify specific ASIN sales performance — competitor sales tracking, promotion impact, stock-out detection, revenue modeling, price elasticity
- Do NOT use when: User wants keyword-level data (→ ①②④), or wants to bulk-filter products (→ ⑤)

### ④ Keywords by Keyword API
- Input: 1–10 seed keywords
- Output: Related/expanded keyword list (with search volume, PPC bid, category, relevancy score)
- Use when: User has seed keywords and wants to discover more related terms — keyword expansion, demand validation, PPC budget planning, category mapping, cross-market comparison, trend detection
- Do NOT use when: User has ASINs and wants to see their keyword rankings (→ ②), or wants historical search volume time series (→ ①)
- Key difference from ②: ④ = "from keyword → find more keywords", ② = "from ASIN → find keywords"

### ⑤ Product Database API
- Input: Category, keywords, price range, review count, seller type, and other filters
- Output: Product list matching filters (with estimated sales, revenue, BSR, LQS, brand, seller type)
- Use when: User wants to bulk-filter/discover products — product research, competitive landscape, category market sizing, brand intelligence, new product monitoring, listing quality audit
- Do NOT use when: User already has specific ASINs for keyword or sales analysis (→ ②③), or wants keyword analysis (→ ①④)

### ⑥ Share of Voice API
- Input: 1+ keywords
- Output: Brand share of voice per keyword (organic/sponsored/combined SOV) + Top 3 ASIN click & conversion data
- Use when: User wants to know "who dominates the search results page" — brand market share, ad incremental lift, competitive threat monitoring, conversion performance
- Do NOT use when: User wants keyword search volume trends (→ ①), keyword expansion (→ ④), or specific ASIN sales data (→ ③)
