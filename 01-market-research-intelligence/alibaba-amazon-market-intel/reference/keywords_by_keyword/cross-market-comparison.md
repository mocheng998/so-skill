# Cross-Market Demand Comparison

Based on the Jungle Scout keywords_by_keyword API, runs the same set of seed keywords across multiple Amazon marketplaces
(US / UK / DE / CA, etc.), compares search demand, bid levels, and ease of ranking across markets,
and identifies "high demand, low competition" market expansion opportunities.

| Cross-market demand comparison | "How do search volume and bids differ for the same product across markets?" |
| Identify low-competition overseas markets | "Which market has the lowest competition for yoga mat?" |
| Validate localization strategy | "How does the demand landscape differ between German and English keywords?" |

## Usage

```python
# Step 1: Fetch data via MCP
# 调用关键词搜索量工具获取数据
# Step 2: Pass MCP response to analysis script
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '{SKILL_DIR}/scripts/keywords_by_keyword')
# Replace {SKILL_DIR} with the actual install dir, e.g.
# ${account_skills}/alibaba-amazon-market-intel
from compare_markets import compare_markets

result = compare_markets(
    mcp_data=<mcp_response>,
    output_dir="/round-{N}/data",
    seed_keyword="yoga mat",                       # seed keyword (string)
    marketplace="US",                              # 单个市场标签（用于 CSV 标识）
)
# Returns dict: {"output_dir", "total_rows", "best_market_per_seed",
#             "opportunity_markets", "market_summary_csv", "cross_market_raw_csv"}
```

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Parse Seed Keywords and Target Markets

- Extract 1–5 seed keywords and marketplace list

### Step 2: Cross-Market Data Collection

- Call `keywords_by_keyword` for each "seed keyword × marketplace" combination

### Step 3: Aggregate and Rank

- Calculate opportunity_score = total_exact_volume / (1 + avg_ppc_bid_exact)
- Rank markets within each seed keyword

### Step 4: Deliver Results

- Output the key findings (tables, insights) directly in the conversation. Reference the CSV file for the complete dataset.

| `marketplace` | string | Marketplace code |
| `keyword_count` | int | Number of keywords collected |
| `avg_exact_volume` | float | Average monthly exact search volume |
| `total_exact_volume` | int | Total exact search volume |
| `avg_ppc_bid_exact` | float | Average exact match bid (USD) |
| `avg_ease_of_ranking` | float | Average ease of ranking score |

### `cross_market_raw.csv` — Raw Keyword Detail

## Notes

- opportunity_score = total search volume / (1 + average bid): higher search volume and lower bids yield higher scores
- Absolute search volumes across different markets are not directly comparable (different user bases per country)
- Non-English markets require local language keywords for complete data
- Each "seed keyword × marketplace" combination counts as one API call; be mindful of rate limits
- Maximum 5 seed keywords
