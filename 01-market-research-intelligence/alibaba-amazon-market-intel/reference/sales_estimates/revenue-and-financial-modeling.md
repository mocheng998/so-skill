## Usage

```python
# Step 1: Fetch data via MCP
# 调用销量估算工具获取数据
# Step 2: Pass MCP response to analysis script
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '{SKILL_DIR}/scripts/sales_estimates')
# Replace {SKILL_DIR} with the actual install dir, e.g.
# ${account_skills}/alibaba-amazon-market-intel
from revenue_model import analyze_revenue

result = analyze_revenue(
    mcp_data=<mcp_response>,
    output_dir="/round-{N}/data",
    asin="B0D1XD1ZV3",                    # ASIN 标签（用于 CSV 标识）
)
# Returns dict: {"output_dir", "total_rows", "rows_per_asin", "columns", "revenue_daily_csv", "revenue_summary_csv"}
```

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Parse ASINs and Date Range

- Extract 1–10 ASINs and date range from the query
- If the user does not specify dates, default to the most recent 90 days

### Step 2: API Data Collection

- Call `sales_estimates` for each ASIN
- 429/5xx errors trigger automatic retry; 422 errors are gracefully skipped

### Step 3: Deliver Results

- Output the key findings (tables, insights) directly in the conversation. Reference the CSV file for the complete dataset.

## Notes

- Maximum 10 ASINs; excess is automatically truncated
- Date range maximum 365 days; `end_date` cannot be later than yesterday
- Revenue = units sold × price; some days may have price = 0 (missing data)
- Revenue trend determination: based on first-half vs second-half average daily revenue comparison; >10% growth = growing
