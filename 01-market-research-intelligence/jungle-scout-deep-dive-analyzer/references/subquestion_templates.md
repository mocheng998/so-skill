# Sub-Question Templates

Template library for sub-question generation, organized by question type.

> This document expands on the SKILL.md Quick Reference with complete sub-question templates and answering workflows.

---

## Sub-Question Generation Flow

```
Indicator Framework → Identify Question Type → Generate 8 Sub-Questions → Save subquestions.json
```

1. **Identify Type**: Detect question type from user query keywords
2. **Generate Questions**: Generate 8 sub-questions (one per standard dimension defined in SKILL.md Step 4)
3. **Save**: Save to `round-{N}/reports/subquestions.json`
4. **Answer (Step 5)**: Agent reads CSV data + indicators → constructs SubQuestionAnswer objects directly
5. **Output**: Structured answers (`subquestion_answers.json`) feed into `final_report.md` Section 3 (Deep-Dive Analysis)

## Question Type Detection

Identify question type based on keywords in user query:

| Type | Trigger Keywords (EN) | Trigger Keywords (ZH) | Focus Areas |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Market Opportunity** | blue ocean, opportunity, potential, discover, find, niche | 蓝海, 机会, 潜力, 发现, 寻找, 利基, 商机 | Demand gaps, low-competition niches, growth trends |
| **Competitive Analysis** | competitor, ASIN, rival, analyze, compare | 竞争, 竞品, 对手, 分析, 对比, 比较 | Competitor keywords, brand share, sales trends |
| **Product Validation** | validate, worth, feasible, enter, evaluate | 验证, 值得, 可行, 进入, 评估, 能不能做, 能做吗 | Market size, competition level, profit margins |
| **Ad & Traffic** | ads, PPC, traffic, bid, conversion, promote | 广告, 流量, 竞价, 转化, 推广, 投放 | Traffic structure, ad costs, organic opportunities |
| **Trend & Seasonality** | trend, seasonal, growth, change, cycle, fluctuation | 趋势, 季节, 增长, 变化, 周期, 波动 | Search volume trends, peak/trough timing |

Default: **Product Validation**.

## Dimension-to-Indicator Mapping

When generating sub-questions, use indicator anomalies to inspire targeted questions:

| Dimension | Indicator Pattern | Inspired Sub-Question |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Market Size & Demand | Search Volume = 148K, YoY +12% | "What is the 12-month search volume trend and long-tail keyword potential?" |
| Competitive Landscape | Monopoly = 🔴 (Top1 > 30%) | "How concentrated is brand share? Is there room for a new entrant?" |
| Demand Seasonality & Stability | Seasonality CV > 0.5 | "What are the peak and trough months? Seasonal or year-round strategy?" |
| Margin Analysis | Avg Price = $30.35, FBA = $5.42 | "Given avg price and FBA fees, what is the estimated net margin?" |
| Barrier to Entry | Avg Reviews > 1000 | "Is the review barrier too high? Can new entrants compete?" |
| Marketing & Traffic | PPC Bid range wide ($0.42–$4.71) | "What explains the wide PPC bid spread? Are there low-cost long-tail keywords?" |
| Niche Opportunities | Multiple sub-categories detected | "Are there underserved sub-niches with lower competition?" |
| User Pain-Points | Low avg rating in segment | "What are the common pain points from negative reviews?" |

## Sub-Question Generation Rules

1. **Quantity Control**: Generate exactly 8 sub-questions (one per standard dimension defined in SKILL.md Step 4)
2. **Fixed Dimension Order**: Follow the dimension order defined in SKILL.md Step 4 (1=market_size_demand, 2=competitive_landscape, ..., 8=pain_points). Do NOT reorder by importance.
3. **Data Feasibility**: Ensure each question can be answered with available CSV data from Step 2
4. **Avoid Overlap**: Sub-questions should not have redundant coverage
5. **Actionability**: Each answer should lead to specific action recommendations
6. **Product-Level Conclusions**: Where the analysis naturally points to specific products in `competitors.csv` (e.g., weak incumbents, quality gaps, niche leaders), the sub-question should be phrased to guide the Agent toward identifying those ASINs. This is NOT forced for every dimension — only where product-level mapping is natural (typically: competitive_landscape, entry_barrier, niche_opportunities, pain_points).
