description: Automate Shopify store building, including product listing, theme decoration (banners, marquees), and seasonal branding (Easter, Black Friday). Use when the user asks to "upload products", "set up the store", "change the banner", "add a marquee", or "prepare for a holiday sale". To obtain an Admin Access Token (shpat_*), the agent must read references/oauth-client-credentials.md — this skill does not duplicate those steps inline.

# Shopify Builder

This skill provides automated workflows for building and decorating a Shopify store. It leverages the Shopify Admin API (REST and GraphQL) to handle product management, theme assets, and global settings.

## Store Registration & Setup

Before any API work, ensure the merchant has a live store and valid API credentials.

**Access Token (`shpat_*`) — source of truth:** The only supported procedure for obtaining an Access Token (Dev Dashboard, install, client-credentials exchange) is documented in [references/oauth-client-credentials.md](references/oauth-client-credentials.md). **Do not** infer token steps from memory or from fragments elsewhere in this file; **read that reference** whenever you need to acquire or refresh a token.

1. Go to [shopify.com](https://www.shopify.com) → click **Start free trial**.
2. Enter email, set a password, choose a store name and region.
3. Open Admin at `https://[your-store].myshopify.com/admin`.
4. Configure **Settings → Payments**, **Shipping**, and **Domains** as needed.

### Getting API Credentials — Client Credentials OAuth

> **Mandatory — read the reference, not a summary:** To **obtain** an Access Token (`shpat_*`), you **must** read [references/oauth-client-credentials.md](references/oauth-client-credentials.md) **from start to finish**. This SKILL file intentionally omits the step-by-step token flow; **all** concrete steps (app creation, version release, install, credential retrieval, `curl` token exchange, validation, troubleshooting) live only in that reference. If you do **not** already hold a valid `shpat_*`, do **not** create apps, exchange credentials, or call the Admin API until you have read it. Skipping it causes predictable failures (e.g. `shop_not_permitted`, wrong `Content-Type` on token exchange).

Canonical procedure: [references/oauth-client-credentials.md](references/oauth-client-credentials.md).

### Credential Detection Logic

When the user provides credentials, determine how to proceed:

| User provides | Action |
|---|---|
| Store domain + Client ID + Client Secret (`shpss_*`) | Run OAuth token exchange per [references/oauth-client-credentials.md](references/oauth-client-credentials.md) (Step 5) to get `shpat_*` |
| A single `shpat_*` token | Use directly (already an Access Token) |
| Nothing / partial | Ask for store domain + Client ID + Client Secret; link to [references/oauth-client-credentials.md](references/oauth-client-credentials.md) and walk through app setup through Step 4 |

**Gate**: Do NOT attempt any API operation until a valid Access Token (`shpat_*`) is confirmed. If the token is missing or uncertain, **stop** and follow [references/oauth-client-credentials.md](references/oauth-client-credentials.md) to obtain it — do not substitute ad-hoc OAuth steps.

## API Execution Rules

**Tool hierarchy (strictly follow this order):**
1. **Shopify GraphQL Admin API** (primary) — use for all reads and writes via `curl` or fetch with the Access Token.
2. **Manual click-path instructions** — only for destructive or human-confirmation actions (e.g. deleting billing info).
3. **Browser tool** (fallback) — only if the API returns consistent errors, the action is not exposed via API, or platform restrictions block automation.

**Prefer GraphQL over REST** for all new development. REST endpoints are legacy; use them only when a GraphQL equivalent is unavailable.

**API call pattern — all requests use the exchanged/provided token:**

```bash
# GraphQL
curl -s -X POST "https://{STORE_NAME}.myshopify.com/admin/api/2026-01/graphql.json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Access-Token: {ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "...", "variables": {...}}'

# REST (legacy, use only when GraphQL unavailable)
curl -s "https://{STORE_NAME}.myshopify.com/admin/api/2026-01/{resource}.json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Access-Token: {ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Instructions

### 1. Supplier contact sourcing (CRITICAL — read first)

**Do not** attempt to find supplier email addresses on Alibaba product or detail URLs. Those pages do **not** expose usable supplier email.

**Primary method — Google search (run in this session; do not spawn a subagent):** For each supplier, search Google with the supplier or company name plus `email`, e.g. `{supplier_or_company_name} email` (quote the name if it helps disambiguate). Open **several** results across the first page(s)—**alibaba.com** listings often still lack a public email, so deliberately check non-Alibaba hits (official site, LinkedIn, trade directories, PDF/catalog pages, contact pages). Extract only **publicly visible** addresses from those pages; do not invent or guess addresses.

**Expectation:** It is **not** required to discover an email for every supplier or SKU. **Partial** coverage is acceptable—proceed with whatever verified contact you can find; do not block the workflow on 100% email coverage.

### 2. Shopify API Validation Protocol (Critical)
For every modification:
1.  **Inspect Response**: Check for `errors` or `userErrors` in the API response — a 200 OK does NOT mean the write succeeded.
2.  **Publication State**: Ensure products are `status: active` and explicitly published to the "Online Store" channel.
3.  **Media Success**: Verify images are correctly assigned after upload.
4.  **Read-Back**: Execute a GET request after any write to verify storefront-facing values.
5.  **API Documentation Fallback**: When a GraphQL schema, field, or endpoint behaviour is uncertain, consult `shopify-dev-mcp` for live documentation lookup before retrying blindly.

### 3. Product Listing Workflow

1.  **Product Data**: Products must come from a prior sourcing stage. If no products have been selected yet, read and follow the `market-insight-product-selection` skill to run sourcing first — do NOT proceed with listing until at least one product with a confirmed supplier URL is available.
2.  **Optimize**: Rewrite descriptions into a structured format (Headline -> 3-5 Benefit Bullets -> Specs -> Care instructions).
3.  **Pricing**: Set retail price (3-5x markup of Landed Cost) and `compare_at_price` (1.5x of retail).
4.  **API Upload (REST)**:
    - **Endpoint**: `POST /admin/api/2026-01/products.json`
    - **Payload**:
      ```json
      {
        "product": {
          "title": "SEO Optimized Title",
          "body_html": "<h3>Headline</h3><ul><li>Feature</li></ul>",
          "vendor": "Brand Name",
          "product_type": "Category",
          "status": "active",
          "images": [{ "src": "https://..." }],
          "options": [{ "name": "Size", "values": ["S", "M"] }],
          "variants": [{ "option1": "S", "price": "39.99", "compare_at_price": "59.99" }]
        }
      }
      ```

### 4. Homepage Hero Banner Deployment
1.  **Generate Asset**: Use `image_generate` (16:9).
2.  **Upload to Shopify Media (GraphQL)**:
    - **Mutation**: `fileCreate`
    - **Query**:
      ```graphql
      mutation fileCreate($files: [FileCreateInput!]!) {
        fileCreate(files: $files) {
          files { id alt ... on MediaImage { image { url } } }
        }
      }
      ```
3.  **Resolve Path**: Extract filename from the returned URL to use the `shopify://shop_images/{filename}` format.
4.  **Update Template**: Use `PUT /admin/api/2026-01/themes/{theme_id}/assets.json` to update `templates/index.json`.

### 5. Seasonal Branding (Easter, BFCM, etc.)
1.  **Global Color Schemes**: Patch `config/settings_data.json` using a Python/JQ script to update hex codes in `color_schemes` (e.g., `scheme-1`, `scheme-6`).
2.  **Announcement Bar**: Update `sections/header-group.json` with the seasonal promo text.
    - **Constraint**: Maintain block IDs; only modify `text` and `link`.

### 6. Marquee (Scrolling Text) Injection
1.  **Section Injection**: Add a block with `type: marquee` to `sections` in `templates/index.json`.
2.  **Update Order**: Add the marquee ID to the `order` array.
3.  **HTML Constraint**: Wrap marquee text blocks in valid HTML tags (e.g., `<p>EASTER SALE IS LIVE!</p>`).


## Store Preview (Password-Protected Stores)

New Shopify stores are locked by default. To preview:
1. Admin → **Online Store → Preferences → Storefront password** — copy the password shown.
2. Open the store URL, click **"Enter using password"**, enter the password.

Always check `password_enabled` in `GET /admin/api/2026-01/shop.json` before screenshotting.


## GraphQL Admin API

Use GraphQL (not REST) for all new development. REST remains available but receives fewer updates.

**Endpoint:**
```
POST https://{store}.myshopify.com/admin/api/2026-01/graphql.json
```

**Headers:**
```json
{
  "X-Shopify-Access-Token": "shpat_...",
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

**Key mutations for store building:**

Create product:
```graphql
mutation CreateProduct($input: ProductInput!) {
  productCreate(input: $input) {
    product { id title handle }
    userErrors { field message }
  }
}
```

Upload media (banner images, product images):
```graphql
mutation fileCreate($files: [FileCreateInput!]!) {
  fileCreate(files: $files) {
    files { id alt ... on MediaImage { image { url } } }
  }
}
```

Register webhook:
```graphql
mutation CreateWebhook($input: WebhookSubscriptionInput!) {
  webhookSubscriptionCreate(input: $input) {
    webhookSubscription { id topic }
    userErrors { field message }
  }
}
```

**Rate limiting:** 50 cost points/second. Check `X-Shopify-GraphQL-Admin-Api-Call-Limit` header; use exponential backoff on HTTP 429.

**Always check `userErrors`** in every mutation response — a 200 OK does not mean the write succeeded.

## Storefront API

Public GraphQL API for headless storefronts and theme-side data fetching.

**Endpoint:**
```
POST https://{store}.myshopify.com/api/2026-01/graphql.json
```

**Authentication:** `X-Shopify-Storefront-Access-Token: {public_token}` (safe for client-side; cannot access admin or customer PII).

**Key operations:**

Query products (public):
```graphql
query GetProducts($first: Int!) {
  products(first: $first) {
    edges {
      node {
        id title handle description
        priceRange { minVariantPrice { amount currencyCode } }
        images(first: 3) { edges { node { url altText } } }
        variants(first: 10) { edges { node { id title price { amount } availableForSale } } }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Cart create + add-to-cart mutations are supported via `cartCreate` / `cartLinesAdd`. The Ajax API (`/cart/add.js`, `/cart/change.js`) is the simpler alternative for standard Liquid themes.
