| Brand concentration analysis | "Which keywords are monopolized by a few brands?" |
| Fragmented market opportunities | "Which keywords have dispersed competition and are suitable for entry?" |
| Competition intensity assessment | "How intense is the competition for this keyword?" |
| Keyword prioritization | "Which keywords should I invest in first?" |

### ⛔ Not Applicable

| Intent | Alternative Module |
|--------|-------------------|

## Usage

Reference script: `scripts/share_of_voice/keyword_competitive_intel.py`

```python
# Step 1: Fetch data via MCP
# 调用品牌份额工具获取数据
# Step 2: Pass MCP response to analysis script
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '{SKILL_DIR}/scripts/share_of_voice')
# Replace {SKILL_DIR} with the actual install dir, e.g.
# ${account_skills}/alibaba-amazon-market-intel
from keyword_competitive_intel import analyze
result = analyze(mcp_data=<mcp_response>, output_dir="/round-{N}/data")
```

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Determine Keyword List

- Extract target keywords from user query
- Determine target marketplace

### Step 2: Pull SOV Data per Keyword

- 调用 `js_share_of_voice`，入参：`keyword`, `marketplace`

### Step 3: Competitive Structure Analysis

- Calculate brand concentration metrics per keyword:
  - `top3_brand_share`: total SOV of the top 3 brands
  - `total_brands`: total number of competing brands
  - `concentration`: dominated (>60%) / moderate / fragmented (<30%)
- Output keyword × brand detail

### Step 4: Deliver Results

- Output the key findings (tables, insights) directly in the conversation. Reference the CSV file for the complete dataset.

## Notes

- `dominated` keywords (top3 > 60%) have high entry costs, requiring significant ad budget
- `fragmented` keywords (top3 < 30%) represent entry opportunities with dispersed competition
- Recommend combining with search volume data, prioritizing high search volume + fragmented keywords
- Supported marketplaces: US, UK, DE, IN, CA, FR, IT, ES, MX, JP
