  End-to-end logo design workflow: brand understanding → competitor analysis → logo generation → design assets.
  **When to Use**: User requests logo or brand identity design:
    - "Make me a logo", "Design a logo for my brand", "Create a brand logo"
    - Logo with brand analysis, style exploration, variations, mockups, or design specs
  **DO NOT use for**:
    - General image generation (posters, product photos, illustrations) → Use image-prompt-guide
    - Product development with market research → Use ai-product-designer

# Logo Design Prompt Guide

Specialized guide for constructing high-quality logo generation prompts using the Accio Workflow.

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL EXECUTION PRINCIPLE 🚨

**When generating design assets (Primary Logo + Mockup/Specs/Variations/Custom Assets):**

✅ **CORRECT:** Generate Primary Logo FIRST → Wait for completion → Use its URL as `reference_image` for ALL other assets

❌ **WRONG:** Generate all assets simultaneously in one batch

**Why:** Design coherence requires all derivative assets to reference the same primary logo. Parallel generation creates inconsistent, disconnected designs that cannot be used together.

**Applies to:**
- Standard assets: Design Specs Board, Brand Application Mockup, Logo Variations
- Custom user requests: Social media assets, packaging, stationery, signage, product mockups, etc.

**Reference locations:** Section 2 Case B, Section 6B (Design Assets Templates), Module 3 execution.

## 1. Logo Foundation (Core Dimensions)

Before generating a prompt, define these two core dimensions to ensure alignment with brand identity.

### **A. Logo Type Selection**

| Type | Description | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Graphic Logo (Default)** | Contains a distinct icon or symbol paired with text. | Building brand IP, symbolic storytelling, memorable visual identity. |
| **Text Logo (Wordmark)** | Focuses purely on custom typography without icon. | Minimalism, strong brand names, Scandinavian aesthetic, short names. |

**Default:** If not specified, always use **Graphic Logo**.

---

### **B. Style Selection Matrix**

| Style Name | Key Characteristics | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3D Luxury/Fashion (Default)** | Couture aesthetics, 3D depth (6-10mm), polished metallic textures, refined contours, premium 3-layer lighting. | High-end Fashion, Luxury Branding, Jewelry, Watches, Premium Lifestyle. |
| **Cartoon/Mascot** | Playful characters integrated with typography, flat vector, vibrant solid colors. | F&B, Gaming, Kids' brands, Mobile Apps, IP development. |
| **Minimalist Flat** | Geometric simplicity, heavy use of negative space, clean lines, maximum legibility. | Tech Startups, Corporate, Architecture, Modern Design. |
| **Vintage/Retro** | Badge/Emblem layouts, ornate borders, textured backgrounds, heritage color palettes. | Breweries, Coffee, Handcrafted goods, Traditional trades. |
| **Tech/Futuristic** | Sleek geometry, neon/cyan accents, circuit-inspired motifs, dark "cyber" aesthetic. | AI, Software, Hardware, Cyber-security, Space-tech. |

**Default:** If not specified, always use **3D Luxury**.

---

## 2. Execution Logic & Defaults

### **Default Behavior Rules**

**Logo Type:** Default to Graphic Logo if not specified.
**Style:** Default to 3D Luxury if not specified.
**Quantity:** 
- No quantity specified → Generate 3 distinct styles in batch
- Quantity specified → Generate requested number across different styles
- Design assets requested → SEQUENTIAL: Primary Logo(s) first, WAIT, then assets using primary logo as reference_image (only when user explicitly requests assets)

### **Anti-Infringement Guidelines (CRITICAL)**

#### **A. Request-Level Detection (MUST Check First)**

Before proceeding with any logo generation, detect and handle requests that contain explicit infringement risks.

**Detection Criteria:**
- User explicitly requests to "copy", "clone", "replicate", "imitate", or "use as template" a specific brand's logo
- User requests to take another brand's logo and only replace text/letters/name
- User references a specific trademarked logo and requests minimal modification or direct reproduction

**Response Protocol:**

When infringement risk is detected, you **MUST**:

1. **Acknowledge the limitation clearly** - Explain that directly copying or closely imitating existing brand logos carries legal/trademark risks and cannot be executed as requested
2. **Offer style-based alternative** - Propose to reference the mentioned brand's abstract design principles (color philosophy, typography approach, visual rhythm, geometric style) while creating a **100% original** design
3. **Proceed with original generation** - Generate logos that are inspired by abstract stylistic elements but distinctly original in all specific visual elements

**Key Principle:** Extract and apply **design principles only** (e.g., "bold geometric shapes", "playful primary color palette", "rounded sans-serif typography", "modular block aesthetic") rather than replicating any specific shapes, icons, letterforms, or layouts from the referenced brand.

**Communication Approach:**
- Be direct but constructive - clearly state what cannot be done and immediately offer what CAN be done
- Frame the alternative positively - style-inspired original designs can achieve similar visual impact without legal risk
- Proceed to generation after explaining - do not wait for user re-confirmation unless they request changes

#### **B. Prompt-Level Protection (During Generation)**

When constructing image generation prompts:
- **NEVER copy or closely imitate** specific shapes, icons, or layouts from known brand logos
- Extract **abstract design principles only** (e.g., "geometric minimalism", "warm color palette") - NOT specific visual elements
- **ALWAYS include in image prompts:** "Original design, must not resemble any existing brand logos"
- Reference images are for **style direction only** - the output must be distinctly original
- If a reference logo is too iconic/famous, describe the abstract principle instead of using the image
- Ensure all outputs are **commercially safe and legally distinct** from existing trademarks

## 3. Complete Logo Generation Workflow

This section defines the complete user-facing workflow with dynamic modules based on user context.

### **Workflow Structure & Default Execution**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**⚠️ Step 0 - Anti-Infringement Check:** Before starting any module, apply Section 2 "Anti-Infringement Guidelines Part A" to detect explicit copy/clone requests. If detected, respond with explanation and proceed with style-inspired original design approach.

**Default Execution Strategy:**

⚠️ **DEFAULT = Execute Streamlined Workflow (Modules 1+2+3)**

**Execution Rules:**

1. **Full Workflow (1+2+3)** - DEFAULT when user provides brand name + industry/purpose, or query is generic/vague
2. **Quick Generation (Module 2 only)** - ONLY when user explicitly requests to skip analysis

---

### **Module 1: Brand/Industry Understanding (Recommended)**

#### **Objective**
Avoid "beautiful but irrelevant" designs by ensuring outputs align with brand context.

#### **Trigger Logic**
- **Default:** Always output UNLESS user explicitly says "just the image, no analysis"
- **Skip if:** User says "skip analysis", "just logo", "no explanation needed"

#### **Execution Logic**

Use `info_search` to gather brand information (website, description, social media, news). Extract context: Industry, Target Market (B2B/B2C), User Persona, Core Value, Personality. If existing logo provided, use `image_analysis` to parse visual elements, colors, typography. Synthesize findings into actionable design direction.

#### **Output Format**

Output brand insight covering target audience, industry, core value, message. If existing logo provided, analyze current visual language. Conclude with recommended design direction.

---

### **Module 1B: Competitor Analysis (Optional)**

#### **Objective**
Analyze industry visual trends and competitor logos to inform design strategy differentiation.

#### **Trigger Logic**
- **Optional:** Execute when deeper market context is needed
- **Skip if:** User requests quick generation or has clear style direction

#### **Key Requirements**

- **Output:** 3 Design Strategies (1 industry-aligned + 2 innovative)
- **Reference images:** Strategy 1 MAY use `reference_image_list` for **style direction only** (NOT for copying specific elements)
- **Originality (CRITICAL):** Extract **abstract principles only** (color palettes, style moods, typography approaches) - NEVER specific shapes, icons, or layouts
- **Anti-Infringement:** Output must be 100% original and legally distinct from all reference logos

#### **Execution Steps**

Extract industry keywords. Use `info_search` with `image=true` to search competitor logos and design trends. Observe visual trends (colors, styles, icons, typography). Use `image_analysis` on 2-3 representative logos. Formulate 3 strategies: Strategy 1 industry-aligned (may use reference images for style direction only), Strategies 2-3 innovative (no competitor references).

#### **Output Format**

Output industry visual trends summary with analyzed competitors, visual insights (colors, styles, icons), then formulate 3 strategies: one industry-aligned (with abstract principle extracted and original direction) and two innovative strategies (with approach, brand value, innovation angle, and risk/reward assessment).

#### **Image Generation Rules**

Each logo = separate image generation call. Strategy 1 (industry-aligned) MAY use reference_image_list for style direction only, never famous brands, always include originality guidance. Strategies 2-3 (innovative) use no competitor references. Total output: 3 strategies × 2 variations = 6 separate calls.

---

### **Module 2: Design Solutions (Required)**

#### **Objective**
Deliver professional, commercial-ready, multi-option visual solutions based on brand understanding and design strategy.

#### **Execution Logic**

**A. Quantity Logic:**

Default: Generate 3 distinct style themes (3 total logos) with clear visual differentiation based on brand context. If user specifies quantity, generate requested number distributed across different styles.

**B. Logo Generation Strategy:**

Batch generation recommended for standard multi-style requests (3 logos in one batch call). Use separate calls only when user requests sequential review, different technical parameters, or complex dependencies.

---

**C. Sequential Generation:** 

Only when user explicitly requests design specs/mockups/variations: Generate Primary Logo FIRST (no reference_image), WAIT for completion, THEN generate requested assets using primary logo URL as reference_image. Default: only generate primary logos (3 in batch).

**D. Technical Requirements:**

Combine brand understanding from Module 1 with templates from Section 4. Honor user requirements (color, size, style). Output PNG with solid color background ensuring high contrast with logo colors (light logos need dark backgrounds, dark logos need light backgrounds). Clean edges, download-ready. Use user-provided reference images to maintain consistency while ensuring originality.

**E. Custom Assets (Conditional):**

Only when user explicitly mentions specific products/use cases: Generate primary logos first, select 1 recommended solution, generate custom mockup/asset using selected logo URL as reference_image. Ensure consistency across all mockup elements.

#### **Output Content**

**Output Structure:**

Total Output: **3 distinct style themes = 3 logos**

#### **Output Content**

For each logo: style theme title, logo image, one paragraph combining design description with design value.

---

### **Module 3: Next Steps Guidance (Recommended)**

#### **Objective**
Proactively guide users toward natural next actions based on their context and results.

#### **Trigger Logic (Simplified)**

**Execute (Default):** Always provide next steps UNLESS user explicitly says "don't suggest anything else"

This module should always run as it helps users understand their options and encourages iteration.

#### **Execution Logic**

Provide 2-3 relevant next steps based on user's situation:
- **Multiple solutions**: Offer refinement/variations, request more context, or high-res export
- **Known product/business**: Suggest mockup rendering, packaging design, or brand collateral
- **User selected solution**: Offer high-res enhancement, complete design system, or application mockups
- **Vague query**: Ask for clarification, offer style exploration, or show industry examples
- **Similarity concerns**: Propose differentiation refinement, alternative directions, or trademark pre-check

```

### **Usage Guide**

Templates are reference frameworks, not ready-to-use prompts. Use Prompt_Principles as technical guide and Template as structure reference. Build final prompt by integrating: brand context from Module 1, user requirements, and technical specifications. Customize templates by replacing [BRAND NAME], adding brand context, applying user constraints, ensuring originality, and using batch generation for multi-style requests.

---

## 6. Visual Component Standards

### **Metal Materials (3D Luxury Only)**
- **Polished Champagne Gold:** Warm, high-fashion glow, ideal for feminine luxury.
- **Mirror-Finished Silver:** Precision and modern edge, ideal for avant-garde couture.
- **Satin Rose Gold:** Romantic, soft-touch premium feel for cosmetics and high-end jewelry.
- **Liquid Gunmetal:** Powerful, sleek, and high-tech masculine luxury.
- **Brushed Titanium:** Industrial yet refined, perfect for modern accessory brands.

### **Lighting System (3D Luxury Only)**
- **Key Light:** Soft from upper-left 45°, primary highlights.
- **Rim Light:** Delicate from right side for edge separation.
- **Drop Shadow:** Subtle (10-15% opacity) to anchor in space.

### **Background Standards**

Use solid color backgrounds (no gradients/textures) with high contrast to logo colors. Light logos need dark backgrounds (e.g., #2C2C2C, #000000), dark logos need light backgrounds (e.g., #FFFFFF, #F5F5F5). Enables clean removal, clear visibility, professional presentation.

---

## 6B. Design Assets Templates (Sequential Generation)

Only when user explicitly requests additional design assets: Generate Primary Logo FIRST, WAIT for completion, THEN generate requested assets using primary logo URL as reference_image.

**Asset Types:**
- **Primary Logo**: Generate first using Section 4 templates, no reference_image
- **Design Specs Board**: Transform logo into specification board with annotations (spacing, sizing, color codes)
- **Brand Application Mockup**: Apply logo to realistic brand materials with photorealistic rendering
- **Logo Variations**: Showcase on different backgrounds (original, light, dark, monochrome)
- **Custom Assets**: Apply logo to user-specified contexts (social media, packaging, stationery, etc.)

---

## 7. Design Principles

High contrast between background and logo (light logos need dark backgrounds, dark logos need light backgrounds, visible at small sizes). Abstract/symbolic icons, not literal objects. Meaningful negative space. Icon-to-Text ratio 3:2, margins 15-20% clear space. Use specific visual terms (e.g., "museum-quality", "precision-cut"), avoid vague terms.

## 8. Optimization Priority

If unsatisfactory, refine in order: (1) Background-Logo Contrast, (2) Symbolic meaning, (3) Material/Color Contrast, (4) Lighting (for 3D styles), (5) Simplicity (remove small details), (6) Typography matching brand vibe.
